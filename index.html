            <p> Hey there! I'm a 27-year-old who swapped teaching for the exciting world of UI/UX design. Why? Because I'm all about mixing functionality with eye-catching visuals to craft digital experiences that sing. I get a kick out of blending functionality with awesome visuals to make digital spaces user-friendly and engaging.
                Teaching taught me empathy, which I pour into my designsâ€”I want everyone to feel included and catered to. I'm all about that challenge, always looking around for inspiration in art, nature, and daily life to innovate within this ever-evolving field.
                When I'm not designing, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen, tuning in to music across all genres, or lost in the pages of a good book. Infusing flavors, rhythms, and stories into my designs keeps me inspired and energized!</p>
